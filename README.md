# Minimal Notes

Every notes app I've ever tried throughout my life sucks.

All of them either only work for one platform (Apple notes/Windows notepad) or they're Notion.

## What's the problem with Notion?

Oh my god. This is not a notes app. It's a fucking disaster.

Do you ever think of an idea and you just wanna QUICKLY write it down?

Well, introducing Notion, the slowest app ever. You open it and feel like you just opened android studio. The whole app puts your entire focus on it. Which defeats the purpose of "quickly writing down a note"

Every time i open this app, i feel like it's an ENTIRELY different workflow. it genuinely breaks what i was doing. I shouldn't have to commit to opening a fucking notes app.

## The solution

Just make a normal fucking notes app that doesn't put your focus on it, and make it work for every platform. That's it.

## Syncing

Yep, you heard that right. You're gonna be able to write a note on your computer and it'll instantly appear on your other devices (real-time) or the other way around.

"But then they get mixed up"

No they don't. Because you'll be able to see what device a note was made on!
